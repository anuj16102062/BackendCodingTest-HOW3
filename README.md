The Event Management System is a web-based application that enables users to create, manage, and participate in events. This system simplifies the process of event organization, registration, and tracking by providing a user-friendly platform for both event organizers and attendees.
    Event Creation: Users can create events with essential details, including event title, description, date, location, and a maximum number of attendees. This feature allows event organizers to easily plan and promote their events.

    Event Registration: Attendees can register for events, ensuring that events do not exceed their maximum attendee limit. The registration process may include user authentication and validation to manage access to event data securely.

    Event Management: Event organizers can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their events. This includes the ability to edit event details and cancel events as needed.

    User Profiles: Each user has a profile that displays events they have created and registered for. This feature provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their event-related activities.

    Event Search: Users can search for events based on keywords, date, location, and other relevant filters. This functionality helps users discover events of interest.

    Attendee Lists: The system provides APIs for viewing lists of attendees for each event. Additionally, there is an option to export attendee lists in various formats, such as CSV, for further analysis and communication.

    Scalability: The backend of the system is designed to efficiently handle a large number of events and attendees. It uses scalable database solutions and cloud infrastructure to ensure performance and reliability.

    Error Handling: The system implements proper error handling and validation for event-related actions. It provides meaningful error messages to guide users and protect against vulnerabilities.

    Testing: The application is thoroughly tested, including unit tests for event and registration APIs, to ensure its functionality and security. Continuous testing is part of the development and maintenance process.

    Documentation: Clear API documentation is provided, outlining the available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples. This documentation assists developers in integrating the system into their applications.

    Security: The system prioritizes security by encrypting data, handling user authentication, and implementing best practices to protect user data and event details. It adheres to security standards and regulations where applicable.

The Event Management System is a versatile platform suitable for a wide range of use cases, from organizing corporate events and conferences to public gatherings and social gatherings. It streamlines event management processes, making it easier for both organizers and attendees to engage and participate in various events while maintaining data security and privacy
